## My process

I used the desktop design first approach(I had challenges working with the mobile first approach)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Learnt how to load fonts locally
- I was able to practicse the use of variables to add styles to elements
- Practised the use of relative units to add more responsiveness to my project

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
  --intro-email-bg: hsl(217, 28%, 15%);
  --main-bg: hsl(218, 28%, 13%);
  --footer-bg: hsl(216, 53%, 9%);
  --testimonial-bg: hsl(219, 30%, 18%);
  --cyan-action: hsl(176, 68%, 64%);
  --blue-action: hsl(198, 60%, 50%);
  --light-error: hsl(0, 100%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

I am still looking to learn styling form validation message later on this project or subsequent ones.
